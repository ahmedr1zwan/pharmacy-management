Welcome to Group 45's CISC 327 Project. Below there are a few instruction on how to run the project.

# Recommended

This allows for Firebase Integration (backend database) while keeping API keys private.
The project works as intended, using our Firebase database.

# Locally
On a local machine, the backend Firebase Integration will not work immediately since you do not have our
API keys and information. You will have to insert the .env file into the root layer of our project.

Once that is done, you may start the development server as normal
```npm start```
