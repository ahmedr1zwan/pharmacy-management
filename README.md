This allows for Firebase Integration (backend database) while keeping API keys private.
The project works as intended, using our Firebase database.

# Locally
On a local machine, the backend Firebase Integration will not work immediately since you do not have our
API keys and information. You will have to insert the .env file into the root layer of our project.

Once that is done, ensure that all dependencies are installed on your local machine by running ```npm install```.

Next, you may start the development server by running ```npm start```.

## Brief Introduction to Implemented Requirements
- Requirement 1: The user shall be able to view a summary of the inventory and sales on a dashboard. On
startup, you will be presented with the dashboard. You can see a summary of the inventory, including the number
of medicines in stock, and the number of medicine groups there are. You can also see a summary of the sales,
with the number of medicines sold shown as well as the number of invoices generated.
